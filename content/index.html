Anaconda.org is a package management service which allows you to host software packages of all kinds.  Anaconda.org is designed to make software development, release, and maintenance easy for you by providing broad package-management support. Anaconda.org allows for both <strong>public</strong> and <strong>private</strong> package repositories, as well as package channels, providing a flexible and scalable service for groups and organizations of all sizes. Anaconda.org is a [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io) product.

Anaconda.org is an evolving service and we welcome your [feedback](mailto:support@anaconda.org) and
questions.

Hosting of freely available software will remain free for individuals and organizations hosting a limited number of packages.  We charge for the hosting of private packages and for very-large collections of freely available packages. For more information, please see our [plan options](https://anaconda.org/about/plans/).

If you want to [author packages](examples.html#CondaPackages) or
[access private package](examples.html#UsingBinstarTokens) you will first need to
[create an account](https://anaconda.org/account/register) on
[anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org)

Now you will need to install the command line client:

    conda install -c binstar conda-server
     # OR
    pip install binstar

Once you have done that, make sure you can login:

    binstar login
    binstar whoami
